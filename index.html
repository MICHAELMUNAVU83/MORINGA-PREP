<h3> WHY I JOINED MORINGA</h3>

<div class="why">

    
    I am extremely proud to have joined moringa school as it is obviously one of the <em>best programming schools</em>
in the country. I came to know bout the school through a friend who finished moringa school and is now a successful coder and has even moved abroad to pursue coding professionally.
<br>
I am currently doing <strong>  telecommunication and information engineering at JKUAT</strong> and this professionalcourse will definately put me above the others.
<br>
I have always been interested in programming and I have taken free courses at udemy to try and get me started.
<br>
I am extremely excited about the challenge that is at moringa and i genuinly cannot wait to finish and pursue my goals.
